## Campus Electrification

UCSD has an obligation to electrify its campus immediately in order to meet its claim of being a leader in addressing the climate crisis. Electrification means replacing on-campus fossil fuel infrastructure, namely the methane cogeneration plant, with a system that is powered entirely by electricity. This electricity would be sourced from on-campus rooftop solar power and from grid electricity, which is currently around 30% renewable. Doing so would eliminate UCSD’s Scope-1 emissions, enabling it to meet its carbon neutrality targets and would keep it in line with San Diego’s goal of being zero-carbon by 2035, California’s goal of zero-carbon by 2045, and the US goal of zero-carbon electricity by 2035 and zero-carbon overall by 2050.

I made an [estimate](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQNYRqWodZvEYYVV0u14JMOikgV-qlmghGtHGD55EtS0LSCDd8iziyfVSxbFZX0K9ucarI1zJJ01PGA/pub) of what electrification would require in terms of energy demand and cost. 

Here's a quick summary:

The capital costs of an electrical heating system, solar PV and battery storage, and biomethane backup plant total $601 million. Annual grid electricity would cost an additional $85 million per year. Total annual costs, scaled by the expected lifespans of the systems, would be $104 million per year, excluding operation and maintenance.

The comparable cost of the current system is an annualized cost of $25 million, excluding operation and maintenance. Adding a carbon tax consistent with IPCC targets would increase the annual cost to $39 million by 2025, and $70 million by 2050.

I am part of the [Decarbonization Campaign](https://ucsdgreennewdeal.net/index.php/campaign-1-decarbonize/) within the UCSD Green New Deal, which has a goal of convincing the UC campuses to electrify their energy systems and accelerate the retirement of fossil fuel infrastructure. You can see your campaign at [electrifyuc.org](https://electrifyuc.org) and learn how to get involved.
