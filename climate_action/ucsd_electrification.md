## Campus Electrification

UCSD has an obligation to electrify its campus immediately in order to meet its claim of being a leader in addressing the climate crisis. Electrification means replacing on-campus fossil fuel infrastructure, namely the methane cogeneration plant, with a system that is powered entirely by electricity. This electricity would be sourced from on-campus rooftop solar power and from grid electricity, which is currently around 30% renewable. Doing so would eliminate UCSD’s Scope-1 emissions, enabling it to meet its carbon neutrality targets and would keep it in line with San Diego’s goal of being zero-carbon by 2035, California’s goal of zero-carbon by 2045, and the US goal of zero-carbon electricity by 2035 and zero-carbon overall by 2050.

### [A vision of UCSD Electrification](https://www.ucsdclimatereview.org/post/electrifying-ucsd-a-campus-electrification-scenario-and-cost-estimate)

I made an [estimate](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQituXFBpATW-eU-SXtkfK80NpO1X1TJTytTbih8ca3SoWe69FoRWLkFWFVodsT2NKY5Y0v9T6llsp5/pub) of what electrification would require in terms of energy demand and cost. 

The result of this cost estimate is, of course, that electrification is more expensive than continuing to use methane-based cogeneration, but we already knew that. The key result here is that the benefits of electrification are worth the immediate cost, and that electrification will save UCSD money in the long run.

### [Get Involved](https://electrifyuc.org/take-action/)

I am part of the [Decarbonization Campaign](https://ucsdgreennewdeal.net/index.php/campaign-1-decarbonize/) within the UCSD Green New Deal, which has a goal of convincing the UC campuses to electrify their energy systems and accelerate the retirement of fossil fuel infrastructure. You can see your campaign at [electrifyuc.org](https://electrifyuc.org) and learn how to get involved.
