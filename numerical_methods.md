## Numerical Methods

**Introduction:** The goal this project is to learn about the numerics of MITgcm. Specifically, I look at the dynamics of the one-dimensional wave equation. A numerical solution for the simple second-order wave equation is compared an MITgcm-style solution of the shallow water equations. The pressure method of MITgcm with Adams-Bashforth time stepping and finite difference spatial discretization is used to solve the shallow water equations with a linearized free surface. Simple initial conditions such as a Gaussian pulse and a Gaussian wave packet are simulated and compared.

### 1. The 1-D Wave equation:

The 1-dimensional wave equation is a simple model ubiquitous in physics classes. Here, I solve the 1-D wave equation numerically for a Gaussian initial condition with a Dirichlet boundary condition on the left and a Neumann boundary condition on the right of the domain. For Matlab code see [wave1d_dist.m](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

}

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
